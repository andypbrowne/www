Holly Cole (She/Her/My thoughts only) has always been focused on understanding the context before changing anything that works. She’s always been passionate about helping the people around her and has a bit of a catchphrase, “My users are my coworkers.” She loves to both hear and tell a good story, so don’t get her going unless you’re prepared to have seven conversations at once that don’t seem to relate to each other until the end. All that translates well into her passion for tools, governance, and process for research activities that allow everyone to do better research with the people they make things for, wherever they work or study. Holly Cole is a co-chair of the community alongside Brigette Metzler.
