Shem Rajoon (he/him/his) moved to Harlem, NY from Trinidad & Tobago at age 11 and immediately got involved with HarlemLive, a world-renowned youth journalism organization in 1996. In the span of over a decade, he was nurtured into a leader and an advocate for the voices within his community. Equipped with a press badge, Shem had the agency to ask questions and a platform to be seen and heard. Today, Shem is a Community Builder and a Product Design coach-leader for teams at software technology companies, strategically championing design, user experience research, communications, branding and design systems. Most importantly Shem is (as a mentor of his often says) "an artist who cares".
