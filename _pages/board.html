  <h2>The Board</h2>
  <p>The Board of ResearchOps (affectionately known as the Cheese Board) is a group of leaders who have taken on the role of shaping and leading the community. Together, they share the task of caring for the community and harnessing all that enthusiasm within it for our emergent profession.</p>
  <p>Each year, according to our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/128YeLiSszdvOkbv2L-61CX1GvLhEAMOJbhSqEHLSE2c/edit?usp=sharing">Terms of Reference</a>, we check in with current board members to see if they would like to recommit themselves to the work of the community. Where board members opt to step down, they form an alumni and act as mentors for new board members coming in. New board members are found via an expression of interest, and come from across the globe. We have a focus on ensuring our community is represented as much as possible within the board, with as rich a diversity of experience as possible.</p>
