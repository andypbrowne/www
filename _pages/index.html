<h1><span class="re-plus">Re+</span>ops</h1>

<p>We&rsquo;re a global group of people who&rsquo;ve come together to discuss the operations and operationalization of user research and design research &mdash; also known as ResearchOps. ResearchOps includes the people, mechanisms, and strategies that set research in motion.</p>

<p>We believe that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ResearchOps is an emergent consequence of knowledge work at scale</li>
  <li>Scaling the operation of research requires specific skills and attention to <a href="https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/" rel="nofollow">corporate memory</a></li>
  <li>Our collective experience holds the keys to building capability within the profession</li> 
</ul>

<p>This website is a record of the work we&rsquo;ve done, and continue to do, to grow ResearchOps as a discipline, to create a shared language and shared resources for people who undertake the operational side of research.</p>
